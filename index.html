    <section>
      <p><strong>Coast FIRE</strong> isn’t one-size-fits-all. Depending on your values, career, and family situation, there are different ways to reach financial independence. In this guide, we’ll break down three popular Coast FIRE strategies — minimalist, family-focused, and high-income — so you can find the path that fits your lifestyle.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="alt-bg">
      <h2>🌱 Coast FIRE for Minimalists</h2>
      <p>Minimalists embrace simplicity and frugal living, which makes Coast FIRE more achievable with a lower target. If your retirement expenses are $25,000/year, your FIRE number is $625,000. With 30 years of compounding, your Coast FIRE number might be under $120,000 — giving you freedom much earlier than expected.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower required savings target</li>
        <li>Quick path to Coast FIRE</li>
        <li>Flexibility to downshift work sooner</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>👨‍👩‍👧 Coast FIRE for Families</h2>
      <p>Families often face higher expenses but can still achieve Coast FIRE by balancing income growth with disciplined investing. For a family targeting $60,000/year in retirement, their FIRE number is $1.5 million. With consistent early contributions, their Coast FIRE number could be ~$250,000 if started in their 30s.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher Coast FIRE number</li>
        <li>Requires steady contributions early on</li>
        <li>Provides financial security for kids and dependents</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="alt-bg">
      <h2>💼 Coast FIRE for High-Income Professionals</h2>
      <p>High earners can often reach Coast FIRE quickly with larger early contributions. For example, if you invest $200,000 by age 35, compounding alone could carry you to a $2M retirement fund by 60. This allows career flexibility in your 40s without sacrificing long-term security.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to “front-load” investments</li>
        <li>Flexibility to pursue passion projects later</li>
        <li>Faster Coast FIRE timeline</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📌 Finding Your Coast FIRE Fit</h2>
      <p>Each lifestyle comes with different trade-offs. The key is to calculate your Coast FIRE number, decide your comfort level with saving and spending, and design a plan that aligns with your values.</p>
